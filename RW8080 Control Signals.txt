1 GPRDOUTL	GPR out to data bus - low registers
1 GPRDOUTH	GPR out to data bus - high registers
2 GPRAOUT	GPR out to address bus
3 GPRDINL	GPR in from data bus - low registers
3 GPRDINH	GPR in from data bus - high registers
3 GPRAIN	GPR in from address bus
  GPRRSEL0	GPR read register select bit 0 - may come from IR
  GPRRSEL1	GPR read register select bit 1 - may come from IR
  GPRRSEL2	GPR read register select bit 2 - may come from IR
  GPRWSEL0	GPR write register select bit 0 - may come from IR
  GPRWSEL1	GPR write register select bit 1 - may come from IR
  GPRWSEL2	GPR write register select bit 2 - may come from IR

NOTE: GPR register selection may come from
	bits 0,1,2 for source - bit 0 selects H/L
	bits 3,4,5 for destination - bit 3 selects H/L
	bits 4,5 for destination or source - both H and L
	bit 4 for destination or source - BC or DE only
BUT: To allow addressing of WZ pair, A/FLAGS, memory - may always need explicit select control signals
	probably need selector signals for both input and output
