8-bit computer ideas

goals
	pack as many useful instructions into 8 bits as possible
	more registers
		index registers with address modes
	arithmetic and logic: add adc sub sbb and or xor cmp not neg
	rotate and shift: rol rcl ror rcr shl shr sar
		could live with shifts by having set/clear carry instructions
	orthogonal instruction set
	stack and subroutine calls
	extensible to 16 bits
	simplify control logic
		instruction bits used for control (e.g. register select)
	I/O
	addressing modes - (Rn), -(Rn), (Rn)+, offset(Rn)
		may require separate adder to keep cycle count down
	not concerned with I/O - one input, one output enough
		input - dip switches
		output - display (ala Ben Eater)

overall
	do what looks challenging but doable, and maybe useful
	use of LS logic (prefer HCT) driven by lack of 74HC181 chips
	use mouser.com - better selection, easier searching
	see James Bates's series on YouTube
	use Arduino for testing control logic

memory: 256 bytes data, 256 bytes program
	use ROM for program memory?

registers: A, B, R0..R3, PC, SP

	A	accumulator - target of all ALU operations
	B	B register - second operand of ALU
	R0..R3	registers - R2,R3 may be used as address registers
		can't use all as address regs - not enough bits in instructions
	PC	program counter
	SP	stack pointer

alternate register idea (inspired by James Bates's instruction set):
	A, B as above
	R0, R1, PC, SP
		allows immediate operand as (PC)+
		push is MOV -(SP),Rn
		pop is MOV Rn,(SP)+
		bit patterns for (PC) and -(PC) address modes can be used elsewhere

addressing modes:

	Rn		register
	(Rn)		Rn is address
	(Rn+)		Rn is address, post-incremented
	(-Rn)		Rn is address, pre-decremented
	(Rn+imm)	Rn is address, immediate 8-bit value is added first

flags:

	C	carry		carry out from operation
	Z	zero		all result bits 0
	V	overflow	(A7 xor R7) and (B7 xor R7)
	N	negative	result bit 7
	All arithmetic/logical operations set all flags
	Must latch info flags register before A is changed!

I/O

	2 input registers
	2 output registers

bus

	single system bus
	ALU operands fed to B register
	A and B are fed "live" to ALU, output clocked into A

ALU
	74LS181 - requires use of HCT (or LS) chips everywhere else
	A register is source/dest for all ALU ops
	have separate 74LS283x2 for PC/SP (and R2,R3 offset addressing)
		jump with offset
		read stack with offset
		add/subtract stack (set up stack frame)
		separate bus?

implementation notes:

	register ICs (octal)
		273 CLR, CLK, not 3-state
		373 not edge-triggered not 3-state
		374 CLK, edge-triggered not 3-state
		377 CLK, CLK enable, not 3-state
			don't really need clear
			don't need output enable - can use 245
			input CLK enable is useful - avoid AND gate (CLK and IN)
		574 CLK but no CLK enable - requires extra logic to AND enable/CLK
			but has all inputs/outputs on same side - easier wiring
			see https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/hgr2nf/8_bit_gpr_my_build/
			does have output enable, but we don't really need that

	A,B	74HCT173 D-type register 3-state outputs (or 74LS273?)
			273 requires use of 245 for enable - no enable on chip
			*** could use 74HCT377 - 8 bits, no enable, requires 245
			diff between 273 and 377?
				273 has CLR - not really needed
			74HCT574? tri-state octal flip-flop
				no clock enable - requires separate clk AND enable circuit
			use 377 / 245 (same as James Bates - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AALVh39X3xw

	Rn,SP	74LS169 4-bit synchronous binary up/down counter
			not available as HCT - use 74HCT191 or 74HCT193
				these are IT chips w/ CD prefix - what is that?
		requires 74LS245 octal bus tranceiver
		74HCT670 - 4x4 bits, independent read/write
			would allow R0-R3 in 2 chips (3 with transceiver)
			no built-in increment/decrement
		use 377 for R0, R1 (needs 245)
		use 193x2 for R2, R3, SP (needs 245)
			presettable
			logic is tricky - requires counter signals high, count on low-high transition

	IR	use 377 - no 245 necessary

	PC	74HCT161 4-bit synchronous binary counter
			these are IT chips w/ CD prefix - what is that?
			74HCT193? 193 is up/down w/ clear
			connect TC of low-order to TE of high-order to cascade
				see James Bates Part 5 ~18:00
		requires 74HCT245 octal bus tranceiver

	ALU	74LS181 - provides all required ALU ops
		not available as HCT

	Use 74HCT245 always?  Would allows us to see register contents

	always decode condition as input to control logic
		2 bits to select flag
		1 bit to negate

	memory - check into AS6C6264 (8K x 8 SRAM)
		or AT28C64B

	decoders / demultiplexers
		74HCT138 - 3-line to 8-line
			inverted outputs - what we need for most enables!
			for multiplexed control signals (load/enable)
		74HCT139 - dual 2-line to 4-line
			inverted outputs
			for register selection (ro-r3)

	selectors / multiplexers
		74HCT157 - quad 2-line to 1-line (single selector signal for all)
		74HCT257 - quad 2-line to 1-line w/ 3-state outputs
		74HCT153 - dual 4- to 1-line selector (outputs low if not enabled)
			for flags
		74HCT253 - dual 4- to 1-line selector (tri-state outputs)
			for flags

	XCHG A,Rn
		1: enable Rn, load B, set 181 to logical B
		2: enable A, load Rn, load A
			doable in one micro-op?  load A and enable A together?

	MOV A,Rn
		1: enable Rn, load B, set 181 to logical B, load A

	SHL, ROL, RCL
		use ALU

	SHR, SAR, ROR, RCR
		???
		special circuit feeding reg B?

	See James Bates series, especially control logic
		Part 9 - 33 minute mark
		fixes problems with EEPROMs not being stable soon enough
			uses 74HCT273 buffer between IR and EEPROM
			uses 74HCT173 buffer between flags and EEPROM
			173/273 are clocked on h-l transition, same as sequence counter
			all signals arrive at EEPROM simultaneously

	don't invert control signals; store as inverted
		connect LEDs to ground for active high, 5C for active high
			LED then lights up to shown when signal is active, either way
			(idea from James Bates)

	memory
		AT28C256 - EEPROM 32K x 8 $8.88
		AT28C64  - EEPROM  8K x 8 $4.20
			same pin-outs, 28C64 has two NC pins where 28C256 has A13,A14
		6116  - SRAM  2K x 8 $4.64 for standard power, 20 ns, 24-pin
		71256 - SRAM 32K x 8 $3.29 for standard power, 12 ns, 28 pin
			any reason to prefer slower chip at same price?
			similar pinouts

	logic chips
		00 - quad NAND
		02 - quad NOR
		04 - hex inverter
		08 - quad AND
		32 - quad OR
		86 - quad XOR

	conditional branches
		decode 2-bit field to 1 of 4, and with flags bits, OR together
		feed to control logic as a single bit

	use separate adder for PC,SP,Rn offset ops?
		one input from register
		one input from immediate operand

	separate address and data busses?
		assume second instruction set for now - should work for first as well
		R0,R1,SP,PC read/write both busses
		address bus feed live by address calculator with 2 inputs:
			register (one of R0,R1,SP,PC)
			offset (0, 1, -1, or data bus contents (for offsets)
		MAR connected only to address bus
		RAM connected only to data bus
		no need for MAR?  Can address bus feed memory directly?
			would save one cycle for many operations, like fetch

control signals:

	PCO	PC out
	PCI	PC in
	PCINC	PC increment
	IRI	IR in
	RO	register out (register selected by bits in instruction)
	RI	register in (register selected by bits in instruction)
	RS	register select (bits 0,1 or bits 2,3)
	AR	address register (forces bit 3 high for address register)
	ALUS0
	 to
	ALUS3	ALU function selection
	ALUM	ALU M signal (logical vs. arithmetic)
	ALUC	ALU C signal (use carry)
	BI	register B in (second ALU input)
	AO	register A out
	AI	register A in
	SPO	SP out
	SPI	SP in
	RAMO	RAM out
	RAMI	RAM in
	MARI	MAR in
	HLT	halt
	FO	flags out
	FI	flags in
	SPINC	increment stack pointer
	SPDEC	decrement stack pointer
	RINC	increment (address) register
	RDEC	decrement (address) register
 	RS	reset sequence (back to sequence point 0 - fetch)

	flag selection uses bits from instruction
	register selection uses bits from instruction
	can multiplex outputs (PCO, RO, AO, SPO, RAMO, FO)
	can multiplex inputs (PCI, RI, AI, SPI, RI, BI, RAMI, MARI, FI)

	combinatorial logic to map 3 bits of ALU ops to 6 ALU inputs?
